# StealingStorage
Open source code to upload files to various platforms. Please create a bug report if you find anything wrong, and feel free to push committs to improve speed/accuracy (thats probably not the right term but I don't really use GitHub).
# Disclaimer
These methods are not reasonable ways to store files. Please do not upload sensitive information using any of these methods. There is a very likely chance with some methods that files will become corrupted, innaccurate, or get deleted. This is simply a showcase of how this can be done.
